# [OutOrInApp](https://out-or-in-app--frontend.herokuapp.com/)

This full CRUD application uses Ruby on Rails as the backend with an angular front end. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/smtlb/OutOrInApp_API/), and the backend hosted website can be found [here](https://out-or-in-app--api.herokuapp.com/).

## User Stories

- [x] When a user accesses the page, they should choose from the following options:

  There are other buttons, but they will not be functional until the user logs in. 
  
 - [x] After the user logs in, the user is able to view all added recipes, edit recipes, delete recipes, delete the user account, or add more recipes.
  

- [x] When the user adds a recipe, the user is returned with the recipe, a form under it with the recipe's values as placeholders, and two buttons: one for updating and one for deleting.
