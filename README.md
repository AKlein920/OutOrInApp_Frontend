## User Stories

- [x] When a user accesses the page, they should choose from the following options:
  1. Sign Up
  1. Log In
  
  There are other buttons, but they will not be functional until the user logs in. 
  
 - [x] After the user logs in, the user is able to view all added recipes, edit recipes, delete recipes, delete the user account, or add more recipes.
  

- [x] When the user adds a recipe, the user is returned with the recipe, a form under it with the recipe's values as placeholders, and two buttons: one for updating and one for deleting.
